I'm a seasoned content strategist with a background in design and photography from UC Davis and a dozen NYU courses under my belt. I'm all about diving into data, trends, and what makes people tick.  I whip up content strategies that cover everything from words, pictures, audio, video, to even the vibe of a physical space.

Lately, I've been geeking out on Python and machine learning stuff. I'm hoping to find a gig that lets me blend my event and content skills with my new coding chops.
