# Hello, world! 👋

I'm a seasoned content strategist with a background in event production and media coordination, a Bachelor of Science in Design from [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) and a dozen [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) courses under my belt. I'm all about diving into data, trends, and what makes people tick.  I create content strategies that cover everything from words, pictures, audio, video, to the vibe of a physical space.

Lately, I've been geeking out on [Python](https://www.python.org/) and machine learning stuff. The [MIT Introduction to Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI) course lectures on YouTube have been most invaluable in learning about Deep Learning. I'm also excited about learning [Mojo🔥](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) from ground up as I've been following its development since it was made accessible in May 2023.

I'm hoping to find a gig that lets me blend my event and content skills with my new coding chops.
