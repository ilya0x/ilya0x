<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm a seasoned content strategist with a background in event production and
media coordination, a Bachelor degree in Design from [UC
Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) and a dozen [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) courses
under my belt. I'm all about learning and exploring new big ideas and diving
into data, trends, and what makes people tick.  I create content strategies that
cover everything from text, pictures, audio, video, to the vibe of a physical or
virtual space.

Lately, I've been geeking out on [Python](https://www.python.org/) and machine
learning. The [MIT Introduction to Deep
Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI)
course lectures and the [PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full
Course](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=i7bEsZQGZZC7rO3B) on YouTube have been
most invaluable for both, learning the theory and terminology behind Machine
Learning and Deep Learning, as well as learning the fundamentals of PyTorch
(it's a 25-hour course!). I'm also excited about learning
[MojoðŸ”¥](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) from ground up as I've been following
its development since it was made accessible in May 2023.

I'm hoping to find a gig that lets me blend my event and content skills with my
new coding chops. <br>
