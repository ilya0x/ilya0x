<summary>A bit more about me. . .</summary>
<br>

I'm a seasoned content strategist with a background in event production and
media coordination, a Bachelor degree in Design from [UC
Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/ "University of California at Davis") and a dozen
[NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/ "New York University") courses under my belt. I'm all
about learning and exploring new big ideas and diving into data, trends, and
what makes people tick.  I create content strategies that cover everything from
text, pictures, audio, video, to the vibe of a physical or virtual space.

I've been in Web3 space since 2018. I have worked with over a dozen NFT and
cryptocurrency projects in various capacities, including Creative Advisor for a
NFT trading platform and Director of Communications for a blueship NFT project.
I am very optimistic and excited about Web3 space and expect great financial
infrastructure and tools to come out of it.

Lately, I've been geeking out on [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python
programming language") and machine learning. The [MIT Introduction to Deep
Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI)
course lectures on YouTube have been most invaluable for learning the
theory and terminology behind Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I'm also excited
about learning [Mojoüî•](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/ "Mojo programming
language") from ground up as I've been following its development since it was
made accessible in May 2023.
