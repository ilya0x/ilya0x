I'm a seasoned content strategist with a background in event production and media coordination, a Bachelor of Science in Design from [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) and a dozen [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) courses under my belt. I'm all about diving into data, trends, and what makes people tick.  I create content strategies that cover everything from words, pictures, audio, video, to the vibe of a physical space.

Lately, I've been geeking out on [Python](https://www.python.org/) and machine learning stuff. I'm hoping to find a gig that lets me blend my event and content skills with my new coding chops.
